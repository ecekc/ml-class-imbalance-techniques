**Summary**

Class imbalance in datasets poses a challenge for machine learning models, where certain classes have significantly fewer instances than others, potentially leading to biased predictions. In this project, we aim to tackle class imbalance using various oversampling and undersampling techniques. Oversampling methods such as SMOTE, KMeansSMOTE, RandomOverSampler, ADASYN, BorderlineSMOTE, and SVMSMOTE will be applied to balance the class distribution. Additionally, undersampling techniques including EditedNearestNeighbours, AllKNN, InstanceHardnessThreshold, NearMiss, NeighbourhoodCleaningRule, OneSidedSelection, RandomUnderSampler, and TomekLinks will be implemented. These techniques will be applied to address class imbalance in datasets, with a particular focus on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The imbalanced-learn library will be utilized for implementation, and visualization steps outlined in the project guidelines will be followed. This project offers a comprehensive exploration of techniques to enhance machine learning models' performance in the presence of class imbalance.
